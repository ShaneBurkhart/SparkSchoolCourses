title: You Are Losing Time And Money By Not Knowing How To Code
---

What if I told you that you are probably losing money for every day that goes by where you don't know how to code?

You'd tell me I'm crazy.  No one is taking money out of your bank account so how could you possibly be losing money?

You're right, no one is taking money from your bank account.  The money I'm referring to isn't money that you have now, but money that you could have if you learned to code.

The truth is that knowing how to code and being able to write your own programs will make you more money and save you more time than if you don't know how to program.

Still skeptical?  Continue reading and I'll explain how learning to code will save you time, make you more money and how you can get started.

<h2 id="save-time">How You Can Save Time With Coding</h2>

Saving time with programming is really about being more efficient.  The whole purpose of a program is to do a task more efficiently than it would have been done otherwise.  By making tasks in your life more efficient, you can save yourself a ton of time.

### Automate your life

There are a lot of task that you do repeatedly that you could automate with a program.  This could be something as simple as automatically sending a "happy birthday" message to your Facebook friends or as complex as automatically ordering an item for you online.

For me personally, I automate my meal planning and grocery list creation.  I created a four week meal plan with the ingredients to make those meals.  Now every week, I get sent a list of groceries to buy for the meals that are planned that week.  I can then take this list and order my groceries through [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) to have them delivered to my apartment.

Overall, this program probably saves me about 30 minutes a week, which doesn't seem like much, but it's actually a significant amount of time over a year.  If I save 30 minutes every week for a year, that's an extra 26 hours I didn't previously have free.  With this program, I am saving over a day of time a year that I now have free to do other things.

But how long did the program take to make?  This is the best part, the program only took me an hour or two to make and I only have to make the program once.  After only four weeks of use, the program will have saved me as much time as it took me to create.  Any time saved after that is additional free time I now have to do things I want to do.

There is a never ending list of things you could automate with a program.  You just have to find things you want to automate.

### Scrape data from web pages

There is a lot of data on the internet but not all of it is easy to search through or run calculations on.  Instead of going to each page and collecting the data manually, we can write a web scraper that will get the data from the page for us.  From there, you can run whatever calculations you want.

In the past, I've written programs to go through Google finance stock data and look for stocks that match my criteria.  I then manually sorted through the results and picked stocks I was interested in.  This saved me a ton of time since I didn't have to look through stocks that didn't match my criteria.

When I was doing software consulting, I wrote a program that collected all of the contact details from the Chamber of Commerce in my city.  I then used this list to find businesses that might want me to build some software for them.  Since I had their email and website url, I could quickly contact them asking them if they needed my help with anything.

The amount of data on the internet is growing every day, and a lot of it isn't in an easy-to-use format.  Having said that, if you know how to code, you can take advantage of all of this data in a time efficient way by building web scrapers.

### Build software specifically for your needs

Software is a major part of almost everyone's life these days, but it's not always easy to find software that fits your need just right.  I don't know about you, but sometimes I find myself fighting the software more than it's helping me.

This usually causes me to be more inefficient with my time than if I had a solution that fit my needs perfectly.  If you know how to code, instead of fighting software, you can make your own to fit your needs.

A few years ago I built a web app for a construction business to help manage their construction drawings.  The app is essentially a version of Dropbox created specifically for construction drawings.  So why use my app if it's basically another version of Dropbox?

The short answer is it saves their team a lot of time.  The company has a specific workflow that they like to follow and there is a whole team of people that use this workflow.  Let's say my app optimizes their workflow and saves each person on the team 15 minutes a day.  With a team of 7 people, that's 105 minutes a day saved by the team.  Now if we multiply that by approximately 250 working days in a year, the team saves about 437 hours a year.  That's 1.5 working weeks saved for each employee, which saves a ton of time and money.

When it comes down to it, you can save a tremendous amount of time by learning how to code.  The examples above may not apply to you directly, but I guarantee you could find some ways to make your life more efficient.  When you learn to code, you'll start to find inefficiencies in your life that you can optimize with a program.  This will ultimately save you countless hours if not days of your time.

### Make you more marketable in your current career

Technology is growing like crazy and it won’t be long until it’s necessary for everyone to know how to code.  Because businesses are becoming inherently more technical, more and more companies are requiring employees know a little bit about programming.

It's hard to believe that almost everyone will need to know how to code in the near future, but you can see it starting at the college level.  A lot of college degrees require you to have completed a programming course of some kind and this trend is only growing.

Fortunately for you, the trend has only started and most people don't know how to code yet.  Even if you aren't wanting to be a software developer, this is a perfect way for you to make yourself more marketable by learning to code.  Learning to code will ultimately make you a more valuable employee which means you will make more money.

### Career as a developer

Software has some of the best jobs out of any career path.  Developers are the backbone of any software business and because of this are usually treated and paid really well.

According to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com) the average software developer salary is $85k a year.  That's an average, which means there are a lot of salaries that are above that as well.  So not only is the salary good to begin with, there is also a lot of room to grow.

Aside from pay, most software companies have very fun and exciting culture.  Forget the boring stereotype of working behind a computer screen in a fluorescent-lit cubicle farm.  Most modern software companies focus on creating fun and productive environments for their employees.

I've worked at vastly different software companies, but all of them have provided similar perks:

- **Happy hour on Friday** - Every company I've worked for has had some form of happy hour on Friday evenings.  We would take off work early and everyone would get together to hangout.
- **Lots of vacation time** - Most software companies either give a lot of vacation time or don't have a vacation policy at all.  As long as you are getting your work done other times, they don't mind if you take vacation.
- **Great health insurance** - Pretty straight forward.  Software companies usually provide good healthcare.
- **Flexible work hours** - Most places I've worked have had flexible working hours.  You could come in any time, but most people got to work anywhere from 9AM-11AM and worked
- **Remote work** - Software developers work on their computer all day so there is really no reason you need to be in the office.  All of the companies I've worked for have supported working from wherever you like.  Of course, they don't want you gone all of the time, but this adds a lot of flexibility for your personal life.
- **Company retreats** - When I worked at SumoMe, they had a company retreat once or twice a year.  I got to go on a 6 day trip with the 30 other employees and it was an amazing time.
- **Much more** - Software companies offer a lot more and this is by no means a comprehensive list.  Here are some [pictures of Airbnb's office in San Francisco, CA](http://www.officelovin.com/2015/07/31/a-tour-of-airbnbs-gorgeous-new-san-francisco-headquarters/) and this article about [3 companies that have cool offices in Austin, TX](http://www.builtinaustin.com/2016/06/14/cool-austin-tech-offices).  These kind of companies exist all over the place.

You may have noticed a trend here.  Software companies really don't care how you work because they realize it doesn't matter if you are getting your work done.  Employees are judged on their ability to do their job and not how well you follow the rules.

Unfortunately, not all software companies provide the same level of employee satisfaction right now, but the industry is moving that way.  In my experience, you can generally find at least one software company that fits this description in your area.  If nothing else, there are a lot of companies that you could work for remotely or you could do your own thing.

### Consultant/Freelancer

An alternative to getting a job as a software developer is to be your own boss and become a software consultant (also called freelancer).  A software consultant is someone that provides programming services to businesses.  Most of the time this involves the consultant making some kind of app or program for the company hiring them.  This could be something like working on the companies product or building an internal tool to help make the company more efficient.

Software consultants tend to make a lot more money than software developers since they are their own business now, but that comes with it's downsides as well.  Since a software consultant isn't handed work, like in a job, they have to spend some of their time sourcing clients.  Usually people spend half of their time coding and half of their time getting new clients.

If you can handle a little more of the business side of things, then software consulting is probably for you.  You'll get to work from wherever you want and make your own schedule while also making more money than you would at a software company.

If you are sourcing clients that want more complex software built (web apps, internal tools, etc.) then you should be charging around $100-200 per hour for your services.

This seems like a pretty awesome deal, but you have to remember it takes time to source high value clients and it's not all about coding.  Once you get it started however, it will be much easier to get clients if you have previous clients to refer you.

### Starting Your Own Business

If software consultant isn't for you, but you still want to start your own business, building and selling a software product might be just the thing.  This could be anything from a simple tool that automates following people on Twitter to building the next Facebook.

This kind of business takes more effort and time to get started but once it's going, you'll make more money.  It's hard to give figures on this since every business is different, but if you charged $10 a month and you have 1000 customers, that's $10,000 a month that your software business is bringing in.

Doesn't it take a lot of money to start?  For people that don't know how to code, it usually requires some up front capital to hire a developer.  Lucky for you, if you know how to code, you can build the app yourself for free.

Building a product and getting to 1000 customers isn't necessarily hard, it's just time consuming.  In the initial stages, most time is spent talking to customers about their pain points and iterating on your product.  It usually takes a few months of product iterations (depending on your product) to get a product that your customer is willing to pay for.

If you can fight through the initial grind, you'll end up with a software company that is bringing in enough revenue to support your lifestyle.  From there, you can decide to spend time to ramp up growth or keep your business a modest size to keep time commitments low.  It's your business, so it's really up to you how big you want to grow it and how much money you want to make.

I find that almost everyone has an app idea and if you don't, you probably have some ideas that are sitting right under your nose.  If you can make a piece of software that solves a problem for you, then it's likely that others will have that same problem.  If you can find these people and show them you have a solution, then they will more than likely give you some money to solve it.

When it comes down to it, you are going to have significant opportunity if you learn to code.  Not only will you have the potential to save countless hours of your time, but you will also be able to make more money.

Okay, so now you now know why you should learn to program, but does that mean you have to go back to school?

<h2 id="need-degree">Do You Need A College Degree?</h2>

The answer to that question is absolutely not!  I’ve worked at Yelp, Carfax and a startup called SumoMe and I dropped out of college.  In fact, I didn't even go to school to learn programming.  Most software companies care more that you know your stuff and not which college you graduated from.

I'm not saying that college is bad if you want to be a software developer, but a computer science degree in college is going to teach you theory and not as much about modern design practices or standards.  Theory is useful but less useful for getting a job as a software developer since a lot of things learned in school aren't used.

Unfortunately, the lack of up-to-date curriculum is a side effect of the field rather than college itself.  Technology is constantly progressing so it's difficult for colleges to keep up.

On top of that, college isn't cheap and it costs close to nothing to learn on your own.  Almost all standard development software is free to use and there are all kinds of free courses that teach you how to code.  Companies don't care about degrees, so if you put the time into learning on your own, there really is no reason why you should pay to go to college.

So learning to code is going to save you time, make you more money, and you don't need to go to college to learn it, but where do you start?

<h2 id="how-to-start">How To Start Learning</h2>

###Just start building something

My best advice is to just start building something.  It helps if you have a project you want to build.  I personally wanted to build Android games so I did everything I could to get started making games on Android. The first version was awful and barely worked.  I look back on it now and cringe, but I learned a ridiculous amount which started my career in software.

If you don't have an idea, I recommend thinking about some of the ideas I mentioned earlier and seeing how you can apply them to your life.  What are things you do that you might be able to automate?  Now you just need to start building those idea.

The key to learning is not about memorizing how to code, but figuring out enough to get the job done.  As you continue working on your project, you will pick up more and more about coding and everything will start to make sense.

The best part about working on a project idea is you can immediately see the results and get something out of it.  Taking a course like Codecademy will teach you how to code, but you won't learn as many practical uses.  What I mean is when you go to build your own projects, you are still going to struggle even though you completed courses on Codecademy.

Most of what they teach you should be learned as you go, and instead I would recommend taking a course that focuses on building an actual project that is appropriate for what you want to learn.

Below is a list of hands on courses that I think might be good to get started.

- **Android** - [Introduction to Android](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-mobile-application-hkustx-comp107x-1)
- **Web Development** - [Build a Twitter clone in 7 days](http://trysparkschool.com/)
- **iOS** - [Introduction to making iPhone apps](https://www.udemy.com/iosdevelopment/)

These should give you at least a starting point to creating things you want to build.

If you want some more help getting started, leave a comment or email me at shane@trysparkschool.com.  Let me know what kind of things you are interested in building and I can help you figure out how to get there.

At the end of the day, by not learning to code, you are leaving a lot of wasted time and money on the table.  Take advantage of the opportunity and don't waste another second not knowing how to code.
