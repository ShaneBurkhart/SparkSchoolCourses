The first thing we need to do is make sure you have everything you need installed. Installation is different for each operating system. In each section, I have instructions for both Mac OS X and Windows.

### Install Ruby

Not all programming languages are created equal and certains ones are better at some tasks than others. In this course, we are going to use Ruby since it is one of the easiest languages to build a web scraper.

**Windows** - Follow this [guide to install Ruby on Windows 7+](https://corlewsolutions.com/articles/article-19-install-ruby-on-windows-7-32-bit-or-64-bit).  After that, follow this [guide to install the Ruby DevKit](https://corlewsolutions.com/articles/article-22-install-ruby-devkit-on-windows-7).

**Mac OS X** - You shouldnâ€™t have to do anything since Ruby is already installed. 

###Installing Sublime Text 3

We need a good text editor to write code.  My personal favorite text editor for beginners is Sublime Text 3.  Sublime Text 3 does a nice job of being easy to use while also including a lot of important tools if you want them.

To install Sublime Text 3, go to [https://www.sublimetext.com/3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and download the version for your operating system.  Open the file you downloaded and use the default settings.

###Install Chrome Browser

The default web browsers on Windows and OS X (Edge & Safari) are good for browsing the web, but lack developer tools we need. Instead, we need to use either Chrome or Firefox. My personal favorite is Chrome so we are going to use it in this course.

Go to [https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) and download Chrome.  Run the installer when it finishes downloading.
