<p>Welcome to my course that teaches you how to build a eBay web scraper. The course is going to teach you the basics of web scraping. My goal with this course is to teach you how to build a simple web scraper that you can expand on for your own projects.</p>

<p>A web scraper is simply a program that requests a web page and collects data from that page.  Once a web scraper has collected data, you can use this data however you want.  Usually, this involves running your own calculations or formatting the data in a specific way.</p>

<p>Our web scraper is going to take a product listing page and get the title, bid price and number of bids from that page.  Once we have those values, we can do anything we want with them, but our program is going to print those values to our terminal.</p>

<p>In this course, we are going to be using the Ruby programming language to build our web scraper.  Each programming language has things it does well and things it doesn‚Äôt do well.  I think Ruby is perfect for web scraping because the language is easy to understand and there are a lot of good libraries for web scraping.</p>

<p>When taking the course, make sure you are trying to understand the broader concepts and how you would go about finding a solution rather than trying to memorize everything I say. My goal is to get you to the point where you can start making something on your own as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-take-this-course">How To Take This Course</h2>

<p>This course assumes you know nothing about programming in Ruby.  Having said that, you should at least finish up to day 3 of the Twitter clone course before taking this course. It‚Äôs important to understand HTML and it will help if you understand a little about programming in Javascript.  Programming languages are usually pretty similar, so once you know one, it‚Äôs fairly easy to pick up another.</p>

<p>If you get stuck somewhere, write in the part that you don‚Äôt understand and come back to it later. More than likely, it will make more sense when you come back.</p>

<p>If something seems off or doesn‚Äôt make sense though, let me know and I‚Äôll do my best to improve the explanation. I want to make this course as good as it can be and your feedback helps me do that. You will always have access to this course, so you will get all updates as well.</p>

<p>If you have questions or feedback for me during the course, email me at shane@trysparkschool.com. I‚Äôll be sure to respond to you personally.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, part of being a good dev is being able to find solutions to your issues. I am here to answer questions, but most things are already answered on Stack Overflow. If you run into issues, I recommend going to Google and searching ‚Äústack overflow‚Äù followed by the problem you are having.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let‚Äôs get started by installing some tools we are going to need.</p>
